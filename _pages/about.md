Hello! I am a software engineer at ~~Facebook~~ [Meta Research](https://research.facebook.com/). I work on Bayesian modeling and lead the development of the PyTorch-based [Bean Machine](https://beanmachine.org/) probabilistic programming language.

Prior to Meta, I received my Master's degree in computer science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (UIUC), where I was advised by Professor [Chengxiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) at the [TIMAN Group](https://timan.cs.illinois.edu/ir/), working on natural language understanding and human-inspired language models. During my undergrad at UIUC, I was forunated to be advised by Professor [Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/) and Professor [Julia Hockenmaier](https://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/).

Broadly speaking, I would love to learn how to build intelligent agents that can learn, reason, and interact with the world like humans do, using laugnages as the medium. I like to study how humans learn to get inspirations to build better AI models. I use deep learning as well as probabilistic programming approaches, or a combination of both :).
